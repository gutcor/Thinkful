        <h1>The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air</h1>

        <p>From western Philadelphia I hail
        where in my youth I'd play upon the green
        'til - rue the day! -I found myself assail'd
        by ruffians contemptible and mean.
        Although the spat was trivial and brief,
        it wounded my dear mother deep within;
        and so, to give her conscience sweet relief,
        she sent me forth to live amongst her kin.
        When to my port of call I'd been conveyed,
        I came upon a coachman most unique;
        and yet, I simply took the trip and paid,
        despite his cab's decor and fresh mystique.
        I survey all the land with princely mien
        in fair Bel-Air, where I do lay my scene.</p>
